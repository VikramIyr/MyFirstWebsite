            <h3>"SAMEGRANMA (ANAGRAMME)"</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed an anagram-finding algorithm using C++. The program allows users to input a word and efficiently searches through a pre-defined dictionary to find all possible anagrams of the input word. The core of the algorithm involves sorting the characters of the input word and comparing them to the sorted characters of each word in the dictionary. Words that match are considered anagrams and are returned as the output.</p>

            <h3>"TCHANZ" [Group Work: 2 Students]</h3>
            <p>This project involved developing a simulation using C++ to model the dynamics of ant colonies competing for food resources. The simulation focuses on implementing key principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. The ants are categorized into roles—Collector, Defender, Predator, and Generator—each with specific tasks, such as gathering food, defending the colony, or attacking other colonies. The primary objective is to determine whether the colonies can reach a stable equilibrium when food is replenished randomly over time.</p>
            <p>The project is structured into several phases, including building the core simulation, managing data through files, and creating a graphical interface using GTKmm to visualize the simulation's progress. The project emphasizes robust error handling, modular design, and efficient algorithm implementation.</p>

            <h3>"Hazelnut Crusher" [Group Work: 4 Students]</h3>
            <p>In this project, I used CATIA software to design and model a hazelnut-crushing machine in 3D. The work involved conducting a thorough analysis of material strength, mechanics, and kinematics to ensure the machine's efficiency and durability. I also authored a comprehensive report in LaTeX, which included the technical specifications of the machine, along with detailed machining and user manuals.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>"Clock on FPGA" [Group Work: 2 Students]</h3>
            <p>In this Logic Systems project, I designed and implemented a digital clock using an Intel FPGA and Logisim. The clock featured a 6-digit display for timekeeping, along with 10 DIP switches for setting configurations, 2 buttons for user interaction, a potentiometer for adjustable settings, and a buzzer for alarm functions. The project involved integrating and programming these components to work seamlessly together, showcasing both hardware and software skills in digital design and FPGA implementation.</p>

            <h3>"Thermal Alarm on Microcontroller" [Group Work: 2 Students]</h3>
            <p>In this project, we used the C programming language to create a thermal alarm using a microcontroller and peripherals (remote, temperature sensor, and buzzer).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>"Deep Drowsiness Detection"</h3>
            <p>In this project, I used YOLOv5 and TensorFlow to fit a computer vision model to detect driver fatigue. I was unable to achieve the required accuracy to implement it in an app.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>"24 GHz RX-TX Antenna System with Improved Inter-port Isolation"</h3>
            <p>This project involved designing and developing a 24 GHz RX-TX antenna system with a focus on improving inter-port isolation. This work aimed to enhance the performance and reliability of communication systems, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex engineering challenges.</p>
